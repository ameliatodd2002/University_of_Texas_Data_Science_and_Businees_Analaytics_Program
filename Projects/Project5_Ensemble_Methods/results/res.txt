Results:

- Best Model: The Tuned XGBoost Classifier was the top-performing model in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, making it the most reliable choice for predicting visa decisions.
   - Minimized Overfitting: Unlike bagging models (Random Forest, Bagging Classifier), XGBoost showed strong generalization.
   - Best Balance of Precision & Recall: Achieved an F1 score of 0.833, making it the most reliable model for visa decision prediction.
   - Business Context: Since both false approvals and false denials carry consequences, the F1 score (balancing precision & recall) was prioritized.
- Key Predictors: The most significant predictors for visa approvals and denials were are whether or not the extent to their education was highschool, whether or not the employee has previous job experience, and the prevailing age of the position the employee is hoping to get.
- Next Steps: Implementing the tuned XGBoost model in a real-world application can streamline the visa approval process by providing more accurate predictions.


Analysis and Findings:

Actionable Insights/Business Recommendations:

- Use the Tuned XGBoost Model: It has strong generalization and a high F1 score, making it ideal for predicting visa outcomes.
- Prioritize Applicants with Higher Education: The model indicates that those without post-secondary education are much more likely to be denied.
- Prioritize Job Experience: Applicants without prior experience have a significantly lower chance of approval.
- Consider Wage Thresholds: Higher prevailing wages correlate with approvals. This suggests that lower-wage jobs may not require out-of-country expertise, leading to more denials.
