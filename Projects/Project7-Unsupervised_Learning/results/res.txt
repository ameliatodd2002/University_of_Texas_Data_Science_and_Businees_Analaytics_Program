Comparing Model Performance & Findings:

- Execution Time:
  - K-Means (3 clusters) – 0.0503 seconds
  - Hierarchical Clustering (4 clusters) – 0.0170 seconds (Faster)
- Cluster Quality (Silhouette Score):
  - K-Means – 0.8070
  - Hierarchical – 0.8042 (K-Means produced slightly more distinct clusters)
- Cluster Comparison:
  - K-Means grouped stocks into 3 clusters, while Hierarchical Clustering used 4 clusters.
  - The two models produced different groupings, making direct comparison difficult.
  

Analysis and Findings:

Actionable Insights/Business Recommendations:

- K-Means clustering (3 clusters) is ideal for a simplified, clear stock categorization system.
- Hierarchical clustering (4 clusters) allows for a more nuanced understanding of stock performance.
- Trade&Ahead can use both models to provide different perspectives on stock recommendations.

This project successfully applied unsupervised learning to group stocks based on financial attributes. The results can help Trade&Ahead provide better stock recommendations by leveraging different clustering approaches.
