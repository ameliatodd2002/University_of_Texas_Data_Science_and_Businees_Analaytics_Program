Logistic Regression Final Model Performance & Key Insights:

- The final logistic regression model retained the following variables after removing those with high p-values. These variables had statistically significant effects on the dependent variable (hotel cancellations): const, no_of_adults, no_of_children, no_of_weekend_nights, no_of_week_nights, required_car_parking_space, lead_time, arrival_year, arrival_month, repeated_guest, no_of_previous_cancellations, avg_price_per_room, no_of_special_requests, type_of_meal_plan_Meal Plan 2, type_of_meal_plan_Not Selected, room_type_reserved_Room_Type 2, room_type_reserved_Room_Type 4, room_type_reserved_Room_Type 5, room_type_reserved_Room_Type 6, room_type_reserved_Room_Type 7, market_segment_type_Corporate, market_segment_type_Offline
- Multicollinearity was addressed before finalizing the model, ensuring that only independent, non-redundant variables were included.
- The final model exhibited balanced performance, with similar accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 scores between training and testing datasets, indicating minimal overfitting.


Decision Tree Final Model Performance & Key Insights:

- The initial decision tree model exhibited overfitting, as evident from the discrepancy between training and test confusion matrices.
- To address overfitting, pruning techniques were applied:
  - Pre-pruning: Reduced model complexity, leading to a shift in feature importance. Key predictors became more refined, improving   generalizability.
  - Post-pruning: Further optimized the tree, balancing complexity and predictive power.
- After evaluating accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 scores across different pruning methods, the post-pruned decision tree was selected as the best-performing model, achieving an F1 score of 0.808.
- The F1 score was prioritized since both false positives and false negatives have equal business impact in this context.


Actionable Insights and Recommendations for INN Hotels:

- The final predictive model can correctly identify 85.6% of canceled bookings.
- Key predictors of cancellation:
  - Longer lead time
  - Online market segment type
  - Higher average price per room
- Patterns observed from the decision tree:
  - A booking is more likely to be canceled if:
    - Lead time ≤ 16.5 days
    - No special requests
    - Not from the online market segment
    - Weekend nights ≤ 0.5
    - Average price per room ≤ 68.5
    - Not from the offline market segment
    - Arrival date is the 30th or later


Business recommendations:

- Implement an automated system where new bookings are run through the post-pruned decision tree model. If a booking is predicted to be canceled, hotel managers should be alerted to make contingency plans.
- Consider adjusting cancellation and refund policies based on the probability of cancellation. For example, rooms predicted to be canceled could be double-booked with a flexible reservation system.
- Continue collecting data and retrain the model periodically to ensure accuracy in predicting cancellations over time.


This analysis identified key predictors of hotel booking cancellations, with lead time, market segment type, and average room price playing the most significant roles. The final post-pruned decision tree model, achieving an F1 score of 0.808, provides a reliable and generalizable method for predicting cancellations. By implementing an automated system to flag high-risk bookings and adopting dynamic rebooking strategies, INN Hotels can proactively minimize financial losses and optimize occupancy management.
