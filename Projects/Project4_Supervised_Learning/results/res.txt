Final Model Performance & Key Insights:
- The final linear regression model achieved an R² of 0.844, meaning the selected variables explain 84.4% of the variance in used smartphone prices.
- The equation used for prediction is: 
normalized used price = -0.41727730370151694 + 0.0196548933373735 * ( main_camera_mp ) +  0.013283854744645426 * ( selfie_camera_mp ) +  0.023546993773401727 * ( ram ) +  0.0015971302387318648 * ( weight ) +  1.2082111403732825 * ( normalized_new_price ) +  -0.03858244293186329 * ( years_out ) +  -0.04183447812024251 * ( brand_name_LG ) +  -0.036832609866963295 * ( brand_name_Others ) +  -0.04721591042782653 * ( brand_name_Samsung ) +  -0.06273438914126221 * ( brand_name_Sony ) +  0.07454635421813148 * ( brand_name_Xiaomi ) +  -0.07154813472250998 * ( normalized_new_price_sq )

The most impactful factors in predicting used phone prices are:
- New price at launch (strongest predictor)
- Camera specifications (main & selfie)
- RAM size
- Device age (years since release)
- Brand influence (Samsung, Sony, LG, and Xiaomi had notable effects)
- Non-linear price relationships (e.g., squared term for new price)



Actionable Recommendations for ReCell:

Optimize Inventory for Higher Resale Profits:
- ReCell can prioritize devices with the highest resale potential based on this model.
- Devices with higher RAM, camera quality, and a strong brand presence tend to retain more value.
- Weight alone is not a direct predictor of price but can indicate valuable features like larger batteries.
Data-Driven Pricing Strategy:
- Even if all devices are sold regardless of price, this model helps accurately predict customer demand-based pricing.
- Using data-backed pricing can attract more buyers by aligning with market trends.
Avoid Oversimplified Feature Focus:
- Individual specs (e.g., weight) do not determine price alone—their interactions matter.
- For example, a heavier phone may indicate a larger battery, making it more desirable despite the weight.
- Understanding feature relationships is crucial to avoid misleading pricing strategies.
