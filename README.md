**McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas at Austin - Data Science and Business Analytics Post Graduate Program Portfolio**

This repository contains all projects completed from the Post Graduate Program in Data Science and Business Analytics from the McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas at Austin.

Breif description of each project included in this repository:
- FoodHub Order Analysis using Python
  - Course: Python - Foundations
  - Skills: Exploratory Data Analysis (Variable Identification, Univariate analysis, Bi-Variate analysis), Python
  - Project Description: The food aggregator company has stored the data of the different orders made by the registered customers in their online portal. They want to analyze the data to draw some actionable insights for the business. Suppose you are hired as a Data Scientist in this company and the Data Science team has shared some of the key questions that need to be answered. Perform the data analysis to find answers to these questions that will help the company to improve the business.
- E-news Express Project
  - Course: Business Statistics
  - Skills: Hypothesis Testing, A/B Testing, Data Visualization, Statistical Inference
  - Project Description: This project used statistical analysis, a/b testing, and visualization to decide whether the new landing page of an online news portal (E-news Express) is effective enough to gather new subscribers or not. The simulated dataset has certain important metrics such as converted status and time spent on the page that will help to conclude the effectiveness of the new landing page. Apart from that, the dependence of conversion on the preferred language will also be analyzed in this project.
- ReCell
  - Course: Supervised Learning - Foundations
  - Skills: Exploratory Data Analysis, Linear Regression, Linear Regression Assumptions, Business Insights and Recommendations
  - Project Description: Analyze the used devices dataset, build a model which will help develop a dynamic pricing strategy for used and refurbished devices, and identify factors that significantly influence the price.
- INN Hotels
  - Course: Supervised Learning - Classification
  - Skills: Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Preprocessing, Logistic Regression, Multicollinearity, AUC-ROC Curve, Decision Tree, Pruning
  - Project Description: Analyze the data of INN Hotels to find which factors have a high influence on booking cancellations, build a predictive model that can predict which booking is going to be canceled in advance, and help in formulating profitable policies for cancellations and refunds.
- EasyVisa
  - Course: Ensemble Techniques
  - Skills: Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Preprocessing, Customer Profiling, Bagging Classifiers (Bagging and Random Forest), Boosting Classifier (AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost), Stacking Classifier, Hyperparameter Tuning using GridSearchCV, Business insights
  - Project Description: Analyze the data of Visa applicants, build a predictive model to facilitate the process of visa approvals, and based on important factors that significantly influence the Visa status recommend a suitable profile for the applicants for whom the visa should be certified or denied.
- ReneWind
  - Course: Model Tuning
  - Skills: Up and Downsampling, Regularization, Hyperparameter Tuning
  - Project Description: "ReneWind" is a company working on improving the machinery/processes involved in the production of wind energy using machine learning and has collected data of generator failure of wind turbines using sensors. The objective is to build various classification models, tune them and find the best one that will help identify failures so that the generator could be repaired before failing/breaking and the overall maintenance cost of the generators can be brought down.
- Trade&Ahead
  - Course: Unsupervised Learning
  - Skills: Exploratory Data Analysis, Kmeans Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, Cluster Profiling
  - Project Description: Analyze the stocks data, grouping the stocks based on the attributes provided, and sharing insights about the characteristics of each group.
